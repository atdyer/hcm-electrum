# Electrum Models for Moment Distribution

This repository contains Electrum models of the Hardy Cross method of moment distribution. Things we'd like to model:

- [x] [Topology and progression through time](hcm.ele)
- [ ] Safety - no deadlock
- [ ] Convergence - a model will always converge on a solution
- [ ] Refinement - Various implementation techniques are refinements of our basic model
